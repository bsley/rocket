# UX Problems
- Savings are not a priority
- What pro features would we have? Reporting?
- No access to settings

# Missing Views
- Budget implication after adding a transaction
- Add New Budget
- Add New Bill
- Alerts
- Settings


# Questions?
- If we're only budgeting for this period and the next, how do we warn the user if they're over budget?
- Most thinking has been around this being fortnightly, what options would we give for "periods" and would any of them break the structure of the app?
- How do we handle credit cards?
- Clear plan needed for initial set up to ensure it's painless for the user even in the middle of a period.
- Where do we store user's data? MYSQL? iCloud?
- Can we run PHP on a phone?
- How we ensure that transactions are up to date?
- What if a duplicate transaction is entered?
- Should we notify the user if a transaction was entered that wasn't them? 
- Is there opportunity in showing "offers" non-intrusively?
